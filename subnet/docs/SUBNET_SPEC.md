# Insignia Subnet Specification

**Version**: 0.1.0
**Category**: Quantitative Finance / DeFi
**Track**: Bittensor Sovereign Infrastructure Hackathon

> **Note:** This document describes the original two-layer architecture. The
> subnet is migrating to a **single paired genetic incentive mechanism**
> (researcher + trader miners matched into pairs and selected with NSGA-II). The
> evaluation metrics and weights below are preserved; the L1→promotion→L2 flow,
> the cross-layer feedback loop, and `l1_l2_emission_split` are replaced by
> chain-seeded pairing, joint pair evaluation, and marginal-contribution credit.
> See [PAIRING_MECHANISM.md](PAIRING_MECHANISM.md) for the authoritative design.

## 2. Build Requirements Coverage

### Benchmark
**Target output quality metric miners are scored on.**

- **Layer 1**: Multi-metric evaluation vector (7 dimensions: Penalized F1, Penalized Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Variance Score, Overfitting Penalty, Feature Efficiency, Latency) scored against proprietary tick-by-tick benchmark dataset
- **Layer 2**: Real trading outcomes (9 dimensions: Realized P&L, Omega Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Consistency, Execution Quality, Annualized Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio) measured against actual market performance, with commit-reveal enforcement preventing post-hoc manipulation
- Published metric definitions with configurable weights (see `scoring.py`)

### Evaluation Loop
**How validators score miners; cost, scale consideration.**

- **L1**: Vectorized batch backtesting — O(n) per miner per epoch; parallelizable across miners
- **L2**: Incremental P&L tracking — O(1) per position close; continuous streaming
- Cost scales linearly with miner count, not quadratically
- Validators converge deterministically (same scorer + same data = same scores)

### Miner Task
**Specific, measurable, implementable task interface.**

- **L1 Task**: Train and submit ML model artifacts (ONNX/joblib) for directional prediction
  - Interface: `POST /l1/submit_model` with defined schema (see `protocol.py`)
  - Measurable via composite score vector
- **L2 Task**: Build and operate paper/live trading strategy using promoted L1 models
  - Interface: `POST /l2/submit_strategy` with position log
  - Measurable via realized P&L, Omega, drawdown, consistency, execution quality

### Incentive Design
**Why scoring rewards genuine quality; why top attack vectors fail.**

- Composite scoring prevents single-metric gaming
- Data asymmetry (miners: public data; validators: proprietary data) prevents overfitting to validation
- Cross-layer feedback rewards models that survive real deployment
- Commit-reveal scheme prevents post-hoc prediction manipulation and timing attacks (SHA-256 hashing with 128-bit nonces, commit window T-35s to T-5s, reveal window T+5s to T+20s)
- The core post-commit-reveal operating model is evaluated against 19 active surveillance vectors
- The latest orchestration run validated commit-reveal effectiveness at `0.76`, above the `0.667` acceptance floor, with a stronger operating margin than the prior run
- Sentinel classified the system as `SECURE_AND_IMPROVING`, with Sybil reduced to `0.195`, commitment violation reduced to `0.019`, and no new anomalies detected
- NSGA-II v13 R2 hit the primary target with breach_rate `3.5e-6`, honest_score `0.9795`, and separation `0.953`

### Market Demand
**Who pays for output and why.**

- **Primary buyer**: Subnet owner's prop trading firm (built-in demand floor)
- **Value proposition**: Model + strategy pairs with dual-layer performance proof (simulation + live)
- **Future buyers**: External quant funds seeking validated trading strategies

### Sovereignty Test
**Subnet survives if any single cloud, company, API disappears.**

- L1 miners run their own compute — no cloud dependency
- L1 validators can fall back to premium public data sources
- L2 paper trading can switch exchange price feeds trivially
- Core architecture (competitive model selection + live validation) survives any single provider outage

### Cross-Layer Data Flow

1. L1 miners submit model artifacts → L1 validators score on proprietary benchmark
2. Top-N models promoted to L2 pool (configurable, default N=10)
3. L2 miners build strategies around promoted models → paper/live trading
4. L2 validators score real trading outcomes
5. L2 performance feeds back to adjust L1 model scores retroactively
6. Subnet owner deploys winning model+strategy pairs

```

### Public Feature Registry

Miners and validators share a published feature contract. Miners may use any subset:

```python
FEATURES = [
    "ret_1", "ret_5", "ret_10", "ret_30", "ret_60",       # Returns
    "vol_10", "vol_30", "vol_60",                           # Volatility
    "rsi_14", "rsi_30",                                     # Momentum
    "funding_rate", "funding_rate_ma_8h",                   # Funding
    "open_interest_change_1h", "open_interest_change_4h",   # Derivatives
    "volume_ratio_1h", "volume_ratio_4h",                   # Volume
    "ob_imbalance_top5", "ob_imbalance_top10",              # Order book
    "liquidation_intensity_1h",                             # Liquidations

    "spread_bps", "price_range_pct_1h", "vwap_deviation",  # Microstructure
    "hour_of_day_sin", "hour_of_day_cos",                   # Temporal
    "day_of_week_sin", "day_of_week_cos",
]
```

## 5. Proprietary Boundaries

The following components are proprietary and NOT included in the open-source codebase:

| Component | Why Proprietary | What's Public Instead |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Validator benchmark dataset | Enterprise tick-by-tick data is the core competitive moat | Demo uses synthetic data with matching statistical properties |
| Overfitting detection metric | Proprietary evaluation tuned for GBDTs on financial time-series | Reference implementation using IS/OOS gap (see `scoring.py`) |
| Exact scoring weights | Subject to ongoing tuning | Published weight ranges and default values |
| Firm's deployment strategy | Prop trading operations | Architecture for buyback mechanism is documented |

Everything else — the scoring framework, synapse definitions, incentive design, anti-gaming mechanisms, cross-layer logic — is fully transparent and open-source.

## 6. Differentiation from Existing Subnets

### vs. Taoshi / Vanta (SN8)

| Dimension | Taoshi (SN8) | Insignia |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Core output | Trading signals | ML model artifacts + validated strategies |
| Validation | Live performance only | Simulation + live chained together |
| Data source | Public prices | L1: proprietary tick data, L2: real market |
| Simulation rigor | None | Full multi-metric backtest on institutional data |
| Buyback mechanism | Not documented | Firm P&L → alpha token buybacks |

### Key Differentiators

1. **The Bridge**: First subnet to chain rigorous ML model competition with mandatory live validation
2. **Institutional Data**: Proprietary tick-by-tick benchmark creates ungameable validation
3. **Short-Horizon Niche**: Minutes-to-hours prediction is technically distinct from medium-term signals
